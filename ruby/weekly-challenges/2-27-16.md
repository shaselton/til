labounty Given an array, find the first element that appears an even number of times.
Scott Haselton @slabounty:  are array sizes within a range or infinite?
Scott Haselton also, can i assume all elements are strings?

slabounty Arrays can be any size and elements can be of any type, including mixed.

```ruby 
a = [1, "bc", 4, "hello", 3.14, 42, "hello", 1]
```
